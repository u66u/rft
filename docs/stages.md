# Legend

1. Type of relationship (more/less than or same/opposite)
2. Sequential (A>B, B>C, C>D) or Non-sequential (A>B, C>A, D>C)
3. Indexes of variables included in the final question (A>B, B>C, C>D - 13 (indexes 1,3) means that a question can have a form of "Is A more than C?")
4. m,l - more than, less than. s,o - same, opposite indicate a specific structure of syllogism if it exists

- sequential/non-sequential syllogisms
- for non-sequential, specify the point of the break
- for late same/opposite stages, specify the exact locations and exact types of premises, i.e. the first 2 might be same, the 3rd is opposite, the 4th is same again
- specify the indexes of variables that are involved in the question

# Stage info

## 1 premise = 2 variables [1-2] indexed

- stage 1: all same, all seq. 12,21
- stage 2: all opposite, all seq. 12,21

- ## 2 premises = 3 variables [1-3] indexed

- stage 3: all same, all seq. 12,13,23
- stage 4: all same, all seq. 12,13,23,21,31,32, answers can only include sameness, not opposition
- stage 5: all same, all seq. 13,31, answers can only include sameness, not opposition
- stage 6: all opposite, all seq. 12,13,23, answers can only include sameness, not opposition
- stage 7: all opposite, all seq. 21,31,32, answers can only include sameness, not opposition
- stage 8: all opposite, all seq. 13,31 answers: only same

## 3 premises = 4 variables [1-4] indexed

- stage 49: less than, all seq. 14,41,13,31,24,42 (so pretty much all with all, but with a gap of at least 1 variable)
- stage 50: more than, seq, non-seq at 2. Seq: 13,31,14,31,23,32. Non-seq: 14,41, 23,32
- stage 51: more than, seq, non-seq at 2. Seq: 13,31,14,31. Non-seq: 14,41, 23,32
- stage 52: more than, seq, non-seq at 2. For seq: 31,13 non-seq: 41, 14
- stage 53: less than, seq, non-seq at 2. Question indexes: 14, 14, 31, 14, 24, 23, 24, seq: 13, 42, 34, ns: 24, s: 13 ns: 24, 14, 31
- stage 54: same as 53
- stage 55: 3x less than, seq, non-seq at 2

## 4 premises = 5 variables [1-5] indexed

- stage 56: all sames
- stage 57: all sames
- stage 58: same as 59
- stage 59: all opposite, seq, a lot of is 0 same as 1? or is 1 same as 2? or is 3 the same as 4? Sometimes is 0 same as 4? or is 0 same as 3?
- stage 60: all sames
- stage 61: all opposite, seq, non-seq at 2
- stage 62: s,o,s,o + o, s, o, s, non seq at 2, seq
- stage 63: op same op op, op op same op, non-seq on premise 2, can also be seq
- stage 64: same as 63, but easier for some reason. why?
- stage 65: more than, all seq, 14, 24, 23, 24, 15, 25, 35, 13 (gap of at least 1 variable)
- stage 66: more than, all seq, 13,14,15,24,25,35,31,41,42,51,52,53
- stage 67: same as 66
- stage 68: less than, same as 66 otherwise
- stage 69: more than, seq, non-seq at 2. seq, non-seq: 13,14,15,24,25,31,35,41,42,51,52 (2 variable gap)
- stage 70: less than, otherwise same as 69
